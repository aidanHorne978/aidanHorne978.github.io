to do an entry while back home while I was feeling emotional, but the numbness
came back. Family is up for the long weekend and God it’s just hard.­­­­ I love
them but I’m not enjoying spending time with them. It’s just grief every time.
That isn’t their fault nor mine but that doesn’t make it easier. I just want to
sit in this room alone.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">I feel I
can relate to Kendrick’s music because he’s a man that has lost and watched
people descend into addiction and he felt himself that he was a savior, a man
that was immune to the same things that destroys his people around him. I feel I’m
at DAMN with still thinking I have a handle on everything but I’m slipping. Do
I need help?<o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" id="ig9wl2"><span lang="EN-US">Came from
Dunedin and a family based on alcohol so of course that was going to be an
issue. I feel I’m more open minded then my blood father and grandad and can
hopefully break the cycle of addiction, but Becky is putting forward some very
good points that for someone looking in it looks like I’ve already hit it. For
me, I’ve grown up around social situations equaling a bottle or two of wine
each for my parents and with mum getting sicker and sicker the consumption just
increased. I feel like I drink nothing close to that and each situation I do there
is a reason behind it. I won’t lie, I’m disappointed in myself. I’ve used alcohol
to survive this weekend and that was something I said I wouldn’t do when I was
young seeing how my parents did. I understand why they did it but I’m not happy
with that as a justification. I need to be better.<o:p></o:p></span></p></div></div></div><div class="gjs-grid-row" id="iqnqp7"><div class="gjs-grid-column" id="ijb9hb"><h2 class="gjs-heading" id="ivg80j">May 2023</h2><div class="text-main-content" id="iaxyyl"><p class="MsoNormal">It's been just over 5 months since my last update. I've moved to Wellington now and I'm enjoying it up here. Every day is still about as hard as the last and it was mothers day a couple days ago which didn't make it any easier. I got a lot of messages from my family, and I understand it comes from a place of love but it just makes everything so much harder. I feel like I'm on the verge of breaking. I was talking about It all last night and couldn't even get through the message Amber sent me without coming to tears. It's not that I don't want to cry, I just feel if I do, It's game over and i'm going to shut down. I'm feeling better today and will hopefully message people back but I'm just hoping this gets easier. I could write here for hours.<br/></p></div></div></div><div class="gjs-grid-row" id="ivlu1k"><div class="gjs-grid-column" id="iqlhjm"><h2 class="gjs-heading" id="ixhfrg">December 2022<br/></h2><div class="text-main-content" id="iue83p"><p class="MsoNormal" id="i8u4fl">The reason I made this website is because I’m back in Timaru and have been for the month of December 2022, spending my last moments with my mum. She had breast cancer and fought hard for 4 years. At the time of writing this she has been gone for 12 days and passed on my birthday. I’ve created this website as a project to keep me busy and productive.<br/></p></div></div></div><div class="gjs-grid-row" id="ierm2v"><div class="gjs-grid-column" id="ib0amd"><h2 class="gjs-heading" id="ixzxs4">University:<br/></h2><div class="text-main-content" id="it8uug"><p class="MsoNormal" id="iizu1w">When I got to university, I found it very overwhelming, but I was fortunate enough to have my best friends going as well and being in the same college as them. University was a lot different from high school and my first few weeks gave me the shock I needed to realise that being laidback and coasting through wouldn’t cut it here like it did in high school. My first programming paper was COMP150 which had programming tests that you would need to solve a problem in half an hour. I got an A in that paper and was really annoyed at myself that I didn’t get an A+. This was the moment I realised I really enjoyed striving for the highest grade and going the extra mile to learn and understand the concepts presented to me. The next years of study got harder and the concepts more complex, but I enjoyed every part of my studies whether it was programming, network infrastructure, database design, artificial intelligence, data structures, sorting methods and much more. If you have taken the time to read this than please go to the projects page and have a look at them. I’d love to hear feedback on the code in regard to efficiency, and have a conversation to run through my thought process on how I solved the problems.<br/><br/>I finished university in 2022 with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science.<br/></p></div></div></div><div class="gjs-grid-row" id="i4e7ht"><div class="gjs-grid-column" id="it1w7d"><h2 class="gjs-heading" id="inwhcv">Early Life:<br/></h2><div class="text-main-content" id="iei77p"><p class="MsoNormal" id="id019y">I grew up in the South Island of New Zealand in a small town called Timaru. By the age of 10 I was already spending a lot of time on the computer, whether it was in the library or at home on our family PC. I’ve loved gaming from that age and found a comfort in watching people on YouTube playing things like Minecraft. After learning the game myself it got quite boring and I found that it wasn’t the game I was loving, it was the process of learning it. When I got to high school I enrolled in Digital Technologies and fell in love with programming and the possibilities of being able to create programs to do almost anything. NCEA wasn’t my strong suit, and I didn’t enjoy it at all, and I barely scraped through with enough credits for NCEA Level 3 and UE entrance. I did, however, enjoy Digital Technologies, and passed that with all excellence credits for internals projects.<br/></p></div></div></div></div></div></body>

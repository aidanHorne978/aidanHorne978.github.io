        <p class="about_me_heading">May 2023</p>
        <p class="about_me_paragraph"> It's been just over 5 months since my last update. I've moved to Wellington now and I'm enjoying it up here. Every day 
            is still about as hard as the last and it was mothers day a couple days ago which didn't make it any easier. I got a lot of messages from my family,
            and I understand it comes from a place of love but it just makes everything so much harder. I feel like I'm on the verge of breaking. I was talking about
            It all last night and couldn't even get through the message Amber sent me without coming to tears. It's not that I don't want to cry, I just feel if I do,
            It's game over and i'm going to shut down. I'm feeling better today and will hopefully message people back but I'm just hoping this gets easier. I could write
            here for hours. </p>

        <p class="about_me_heading">December 2022</p>
        <p class="about_me_paragraph"> The reason I made this website is because I’m back in Timaru and have been for the month of December 2022, 
            spending my last moments with my mum. She had breast cancer and fought hard for 4 years. 
            At the time of writing this she has been gone for 12 days and passed on my birthday. I’ve created this website as a project 
            to keep me busy and productive. </p>

        <p class="about_me_heading">Early Life:</p>
        <p class="about_me_paragraph">I grew up in the South Island of New Zealand in a small town called Timaru. 
            By the age of 10 I was already spending a lot of time on the computer, whether it was in the library or at home on our family PC. 
            I’ve loved gaming from that age and found a comfort in watching people on YouTube playing things like Minecraft. 
            After learning the game myself it got quite boring and I found that it wasn’t the game I was loving, it was the process of learning it. 
            When I got to high school I enrolled in Digital Technologies and fell in love with programming and the possibilities of being able to create programs 
            to do almost anything. NCEA wasn’t my strong suit, and I didn’t enjoy it at all, and I barely scraped through with enough credits for NCEA Level 3 and UE entrance. 
            I did, however, enjoy Digital Technologies, and passed that with all excellence credits for internals projects.</p>

        <p class="about_me_heading">University:</p>
        <p class="about_me_paragraph">When I got to university, I found it very overwhelming, but I was fortunate enough to have my best friends going 
            as well and being in the same college as them. University was a lot different from high school and my first few weeks gave me the shock I 
            needed to realise that being laidback and coasting through wouldn’t cut it here like it did in high school. My first programming paper was 
            COMP150 which had programming tests that you would need to solve a problem in half an hour. I got an A in that paper and was really annoyed at 
            myself that I didn’t get an A+. This was the moment I realised I really enjoyed striving for the highest grade and going the extra mile to 
            learn and understand the concepts presented to me. The next years of study got harder and the concepts more complex, but I enjoyed every part 
            of my studies whether it was programming, network infrastructure, database design, artificial intelligence, data structures, sorting methods 
            and much more. If you have taken the time to read this than please go to the projects page and have a look at them. I’d love to hear feedback 
            on the code in regard to efficiency, and have a conversation to run through my thought process on how I solved the problems. </p>   
        
        <p class="about_me_paragraph">I finished university in 2022 with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. </p>
